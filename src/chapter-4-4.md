1. Defining the Competitive Landscape
-------------------------------------

Before diving into detailed analysis, it is important to identify and define the competitors operating in the same space.

Direct competitors typically offer similar AI-based recommendation systems, and studying their strategies can provide valuable insights. This involves examining their algorithms, data sources, user interfaces, and personalization techniques. Additionally, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses, market share, and customer satisfaction levels can help in understanding how they differentiate themselves from others in the market.

### 1.2 Indirect Competitors Analysis

Indirect competitors might not offer the exact same product or service recommendations but target a similar audience. Analyzing their approaches, market positioning, and unique value propositions can uncover alternative ways of addressing user needs. This analysis enables the identification of potential gaps and opportunities for differentiation in the market.
